# how_not_to
 counterpart/supplement to the excellent Jai how_tos

This is just an experiment, I may totally ditch this later. But it seems useful
to document how *not* to do things in this language, with a dash of explaining
some rationale behind why you *can't* do things, despite it seeming intuitive
if you're coming from some different languages that do things differently.
